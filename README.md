# PresentOpener

PresentOpener is a mod for Terraria using tModLoader. You can install it via the in game mod browser or from the .tmod file inside the releases page.

## What does it do?

PresentOpener aims to reduce the amount of RNG from presents and goodie bags by letting you adjust the rates of each item to be obtained.

## Okay, why should I download this?

This mod is very handy for collecting items that would otherwise require the season to be active, like the Bat hook or the Hand Warmer.
Also, some mods may use these items for their recipes. Also included is support for Thorium and Spirit's items, too!
