# PresentOpener

PresentOpener is a mod for Terraria using tModLoader. You can install it via the in game mod browser or from the .tmod file inside the repository.

## What does it do?

PresentOpener aims to reduce the amount of RNG from presents and goodie bags by creating crafting stations that "open" them. Most of the time you will need more than one present to use the crafting stations.

## Okay, why should I download this?

Since the crafting stations are locked post plantera, there's a few extra ways to use this mod.
1. If another mod requires an item from the present (Ex: Fargo Soul Mod requires Unlucky Yarn), you can obtain it slightly easier.
2. Collection purposes.
3. If you also have the Thorium Mod, you can obtain the very useful arena block Mistletoe. Also, has spirit mod support for all the candies and masks.

This mod was never intended to be major, but is designed to help you with certain tasks during the seasons.

### PS: Fargo's Mutant Mod is very handy for obtaining presents and goodie bags!
