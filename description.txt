v2.1.1.1
- Fixed "Reset Defaults" button defaulting each scale to 0.
- Config no longer freaks out and gives you a decimal like 0.2489, scales every 0.25 now
- Removed processors and the recipes with them. It was nice knowing them, but Fargo beat me to that.
- Presents and goodie bags can be earned outside of Christmas and Halloween, at a much lower chance.
- Minor Code improvements
- Fixed a recurring bug where the mod dev would go on hiatus over fixes... again... Let's hope it works this time.

Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents! Well, to an extent. You can use the ModConfig to adjust the rate at which you can get rare items from presents and goodie bags!
