v2.1.2
- Removed the Processors and recipes.
- Presents and Goodie Bags can drop outside of their respective season at a 3 times reduced chance.
- Minor Improvements to the opening system.
- Config scales are no longer flimsy and should only have multipliers to the first decimal place.
- New icon!

Unlike real life, this mod will influence what you get out of your present with minimal effort! just tweak the scales through the ModConfig setup.

Credit to TheRedStoneBro for the improved icon!
