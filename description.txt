v2.1.0.2
You can adjust the config without reloading.
You can disable the config entirely and move back to the vanilla drop chances.
You can no longer adjust the config if you are not the host of a server.
Added an unobtainable item cause I felt like it

Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents!
You are able to craft both Processors with the remains of the Mechanical Bosses. Alternatively, you can fight the Frost Moon and Pumpkin moon to have a chance to get each.

Now with a Mod Config! You are able to adjust the chances of getting what you want out of your present.

Credit goes to Maker of Scratchock for making the processor sprites, and Panini for helping with condensing the recipes.
