v2.1.0.1 - Adjusted a lot of the config. You can now scale with decimals, everything is neat into one config, and you can also disable the adjustment rates.
Also fixed a bug where the mod developer would go on hiatus for 3 months with a simple bug to fix.

Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents!
You are able to craft both Processors with the remains of the Mechanical Bosses. Alternatively, you can fight the Frost Moon and Pumpkin moon to have a chance to get each.

Now with a Mod Config! You are able to adjust the chances of getting what you want out of your present.

Credit goes to Maker of Scratchock for making the processor sprites, and Panini for helping with condensing the recipes.
