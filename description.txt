v2.1.1
- Modded items can be found again in Presents if you have the configs enabled.
- There is a scale for these items now, it's in their own config folder. (Spirit Mod Masks/Candies, Thorium Mod Mistletoe)
- Fixed "Reset Defaults" button defaulting each scale to 0.

Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents!
You are able to craft both Processors with the remains of the Mechanical Bosses and a Frost Core/Forbidden Fragment. Alternatively, you can fight the Frost Moon and Pumpkin moon to have a chance to get each.

Now with a Mod Config! You are able to adjust the chances of getting what you want out of your present.

Credit goes to Maker of Scratchock for making the processor sprites, and Panini for helping with condensing the recipes.
