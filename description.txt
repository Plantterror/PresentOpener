[i:1869] v3.0 [i:1869]
- Yes, I've rebooted this shitty mod for the third time now.
- Processors are back, and with a stylish UI to let you "unwrap" Presents and Goodie Bags!
- Added a few items that controls the power of dropping rarer itemss (still customizable)
- Yet more code optimizations behind the back because I'm bad
- German and Spanish translations.
- Deleted my life, too confusing for new players.

Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents!
You can craft the Present and Goodie Processor through a variety of hardmode materals. Once unlocked, you can place a Present or Goodie Bag in them to choose exactly the type of item you want from your bag!
