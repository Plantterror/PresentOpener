Unlike real life, this mod lets you choose what you get from your presents!

Multiple Presents are required at a Present Manager for the Christmas recipes to work. You can craft one with an Ice Queen Drop, or get it from Everscream.
Multiple Goodie Bags are required at a Goodie Bag Manager for the Halloween recipes to work. You can craft one with a Pumpking Drop, or get it from Mourning Wood.

Credit goes to Maker of Scratchock for making the icon and the station sprites.
